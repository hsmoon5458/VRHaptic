1. Object Instatiation
In 'FingertipBehavior', check the Thumb and Index fingers touch which opponent fingertips.
In 'NetworkObjectManager', if the condition meets, instantiate the objects.

2. Object Grab(rotating, positioning)
It consists of two scripts. 'GrabBehavior' and 'GrabbableBehavior'.
'GrabBehavior' attached to collider on each hand. In the script, if the Thumb, Index, and networkObject
are all touched (three conditions), then it is considered as grabbed. While it is grabbed, if the Thumb and Index
exit the trigger (not touched), it is considered as ungrabbed.

'GrabbableBehavior' which is attacehd to all network objects, if the grabbed is true, and grabbed object
is referenced by 'GrabBehavior' script, only that object will be grabbed.

To rotate and position, the network object is set parent to network spawned player. If it the parent
is set to HankOVRCameraRig, during the network play, the object is moving to wrong point. It is important to
set parent to Network player. It is availaibe by NetoworkID generated by Photon Pun. It is defined in 
Start function in 'GrabbableBehavior'.
